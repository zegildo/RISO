[Jaguar Cars] consulted with a [yacht design specialist] and a [bespoke design project management company] throughout the development of the Concept Speedboat.
The Concept [Speedboat] has a [gel coat fibreglass] hull finished on top with a [natural teak decking]. This is split by a [carbon fibre fin], inspired by the iconic [Jaguar D-Type]. 
The front of the boat flows seamlessly into the screen and the red 2+1 cabin follows the [sporting character of Jaguar cars]. 
[Jaguar Cars heritage] is also subtly recognised with [fuel filler caps] inspired by the [Series 1 XJ].
A [polished aluminium propeller] and pop-up mooring post imitates how the boat could be powered and docked respectively.
