The [jaguar], [Panthera onca], is the only extant [New World member] of the [Panthera genus]. 
DNA evidence shows the [lion], [tiger], [leopard], [jaguar], [snow leopard], and clouded [leopard] share a common ancestor, and that this group is between [six and ten million years old]; the fossil record points to the emergence of [Panthera] just two to 3.8 million years ago.
Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard ([Neofelis nebulosa]) is basal to this group.
The position of the remaining [species] varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.
